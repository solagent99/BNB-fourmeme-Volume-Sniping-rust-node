# BSC Four.meme Snipping, Vplume, Bundler ‚Äî Rust (executor) + Node.js (orchestrator)

**Hybrid demo (production-style)**: a high-performance **Rust** executor for the execution hot-path, and a flexible **Node.js / TypeScript** orchestrator for event listening, heuristics and orchestration.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This repository is a demo intended for testnet / forked mainnet use only. Do NOT use with real funds on mainnet until you fully audit, harden, and secure your deployment.**

## Purpose

This project demonstrates a pragmatic production-style architecture used for high-frequency DeFi operations:

### Workflow & Bot Functions
- 1. **PairCreated**: Node.js orchestrator subscribes to liquidity events.
- 2. **Pre-Buy Checks**: owner check, transfer simulation, ERC20 metadata, getAmountsOut validation.
- 3. **Volume Bot**: monitors BNB volume on pairs; triggers alerts or bundler buys when thresholds exceeded.
- 4. **Token Bundler**: batches multiple buy tasks and sends them concurrently to the Rust executor.
- 5. **Telegram Notifier**: alerts you on:
    High-volume pairs
    Bundler buy success/failure
    Pre-buy check results

- **Node orchestrator (TypeScript)** ‚Äî listens for `PairCreated` and liquidity events, performs heuristics/pre-checks, posts buy requests to executor. (Signal Handler, Bundler Execution Signal, Volume Execution Signal)
- **Rust executor (Actix + ethers-rs)** ‚Äî minimal, deterministic hot-path that builds/signs/submits swap transactions (`swapExactETHForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens`).

The split keeps fast deterministic transaction logic in Rust and flexible orchestration logic in Node for quick iteration.

### Development notes & architecture rationale
- **Rust Executor**: deterministic, low-latency, compiled binary for the critical path. Ideal for signing & sending txs reliably.
- **Node orchestrator**: fast iteration, rich DeFi tooling, easier to write heuristics/token-safety scans, and integrations (alerts, UIs).
- Keep the hot-path as small as possible ‚Äî business logic, heavy checks, ML scoring should live in orchestrator or a separate service.

### CI / Docker / Deployment notes
- **Add GitHub Actions workflows**:
  Rust: cargo fmt -- --check, cargo clippy, cargo build --release
  Node: npm ci, npm run lint, npm run build
- Dockerize executor & orchestrator with environment variables injected at runtime (do NOT bake secrets).
- Use container orchestration (K8s) or systemd with secret mounts for production.
